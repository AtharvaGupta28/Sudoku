# [Sudoku](https://sudoku-atharva.onrender.com/)
## Version 2.0
I have used Nodejs, express js to build the backend of this project, and the axios package to send server side requests to a public API.
The result received from the API in JSON is parsed into a java script object and then the 9x9 sudoku grid is displayed.
I have hosted this project using a free web hosting service provided by https://render.com/

This is my first attempt at making a static website after learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Will further try to make the website dynamic.
Currently learning about API's
